# Scheduled Post Shortcut

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0%2B-red.svg)](https://github.com/pressware/scheduled-post-shortcut/blob/master/license.txt)

Easily access your scheduled posts from the WordPress dashboard and with
keyboard shortcuts.

## Description

If you're someone who blogs with any type of regularity, then you likely have a
number of posts sitting in the scheduled queue in your WordPress back-end.

The problem? It's a little tedious to access them. You have to navigate through
the *Posts* menu, view *All Posts* then click on the *Scheduled* tab. And if
you're an author who spends a lot of time in WordPress, then this can become
a bit of a chore.

Scheduled Post Shortcut aims to make this easier. The plugin introduces a new
*Scheduled* menu item under the *Posts* menu that will take you directly to the
*Scheduled Posts* page so that you can manage your content.

This is yet another plugin that aims to streamline your blogging process. Should
you opt to uninstall this plugin, then no data will be lost or affected.
